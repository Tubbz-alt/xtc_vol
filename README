Link to this document: https://github.com/slac-lcls/lcls2/blob/master/xtc_vol/README
Dependencies:
	CMake: version 3.10 or newer.
	XTC: CMakeLists assumes it's installed to /usr/local, or you can change the find_library line in "Dependency: XTC" section in CMakeLists.txt.
	MPI: CMakeLists assumes it's installed to /usr/local, or you can change the "include_directories" line in "Dependency: MPI" section in CMakeLists.txt.
	HDF5: CMakeLists assumes it's installed to ../../hdf5_build/hdf5, or you can change the set(HDF5_HOME ...) line in "Dependecy: HDF5" section in CMakeLists.txt.

To build XTC2_VOL project, please follow these steps:
	0. Go to LCLS2 directory, assume we have the lcls2 repo at /home/my_name/lcls2 
	1. In the source directory (/home/my_name/lcls2/xtc_vol/) edit CMakeList.txt
		Find "set HDF5_HOME" line, and change it to your HDF5 install location. It should be the one contains include/, lib/, bin/ directories, such as "/home/my_name/hdf5_build/hdf5".
	2. Create a build directory, such as xtc_vol/build
	3. cd xtc_vol/build	# currently in xtc_vol/
	4. cmake ..			# currently in build/
	5. make				# currently in build/

Environment variables
	export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=/home/my_name/lcls2/xtc_vol/build
	export HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR="xtc_vol under_vol=0;under_info={};"

Run the demo
	After build the xtc_vol library and set environment variables, HDF5 can read xtc2 files. Currently, both xtc2 file and corresponding smd file are needed. Sample files are included: data.xtc and data.smd.xtc2.
	Use a HDF5 tool h5ls for demostration, run 
		$HDF5_HOME/bin/h5ls -r data.xtc2
	and h5ls will show the xtc2 data in the HDF5 hierarchy. Add -v option for more details of the metadata.
